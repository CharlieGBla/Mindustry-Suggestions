**Describe the content or mechanics you are proposing.**
What my proposal is: a way to make thorium where there is none, but keep in mine, the building will cost thorium to make, so you will have to be past the loadout limit. The concept is simple, and i know why it hasant been made, because peope could just play ground zero and farm thor, but heres the catch. Slag and SURGE. 10 units of slag and 2 units of surge will create 4 thorium units. it would be the size of a impact, (4x4) and cost, well, expensive, im not sure, but it needs to cost thorium to build. The power i think would be equivilent of a thor reactor, (870 if i remember?). so thats the heart of my pitch. thank you for your time.


**Describe how you think this content will improve the game. If you're proposing new content, mention how it may add more gameplay options or how it will fill a new niche.**
So wwith this option, the *EXPERIENCED* player would be able to get small amounts of thorium for examply, if you wanted spectres, you could make some right there and not lug thor all the way over. or you could farm thor on easier levels, even though you get plany from other levels, i think its a neccicary option simply because somtimes you just need thorium.
